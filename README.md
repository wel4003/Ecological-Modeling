# Ecological-Modeling
This collection of Matlab scripts simulate ecolosystem dynamics based on the Lotka-Volterra model.<br>
There's 3 files now:<br>
<b>CleanedUp_LotkaVolterra_ThreeSpecies_Wendy:</b> Cleaned up version of Wendy's implementation of the 3 species Lotka-Volterra predator prey system for Current Ops paper.<br>
<b>LotkaVolterra.m:</b> Wendy's implementation of the 2 species Lotka-Volterra predator prey system.<br>
<b>LotkaVolterraJoaosNotes.m:</b> The same, but with a few changes made by Joao and some annotation to explain the changes.<br>
<b>TwoSpeciesLotkaVolterraMatrixForm.m:</b> The same 2 species system but now in matrix form.<br>
